# CFLOW

## Make Examples

- Make cursor Docs.
- Make examples that are just like Pocketflow... look how those docs are and try this out in Cursor.
- the goal is quickly generated stuff...
- ***How do we serve this to people?  Do we really want have the underlying code floating out there for everyone? ===> Probably NOT!***

## NON-CURSOR CFLOW WORKFLOW ENGINEER:

- build the Agent GRAPH:  similar to the s17 Engineer... but make it better.  Break it up like Cursor does... 
- Check for unsafe keywords via Regex, injections, keys, and unsafe Py fn practices.


## Hijacking the _post via Monkey Patching
- Need to think about memory here.
    - Memory is shared or Agentic?  Cwazy... need to think deeply about that: embeddings, RAG, vs just naieve.

## Ultimate test

- Rebuild something big, how fast can we do it?  How much better is it?
    - PRELOAD?

- How do we serve this to people?
